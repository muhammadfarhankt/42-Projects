# Libft

Libft is the first project of the 42 curriculum. Its goal is to recreate essential C standard library functions and additional utilities that will be reused in future projects.  
<BR> It provides custom implementations for character checks, memory utilities, string manipulation, conversions, file-descriptor outputs, and linked-list operations.

## Instructions

#### Compilation
```bash
make        # build libft.a
make clean  # remove .o files
make fclean # remove .o files + libft.a
make re     # rebuild everything
```
